![Example of pidisplay showing the message "Hi!"](https://github.com/andreivoda/pidisplay/blob/main/images/example_text.png?raw=true)

This is a project I've been working on with the intention to discover electronics and microcontroller programming in C however working with a previously owned Raspberry Pi helped me turn the display into something more practical.

Current features include:
  - browser control
  - display scrolling text messages
  - play snake
  - display time and schedule tasks
  - display animations (spiral, tear drop, clearing screen, etc...)
  - brigtness control
  - custom characters (arrows, smiley face)

Future work:
  - display temperature
  - display important news / sports fixtures or results
  - reminders
  - improve web interface

Included schematics and pictures for anyone interested.
